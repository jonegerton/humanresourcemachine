# Human Resource Machine Solutions
Saved solutions for [Human Resource Machine game](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)



## Solutions

Solutions are in the numbered folders.

- NN.hrm: Solution covers both speed and line count challenges
- NN.lines.hrm: Solution covers the line count challenge
- NN.speed.hrm: Solution covers the speed challenge
- NN.nice.hrm: Where the line and speed challenge code is deliberately "ugly", this solution is a nicer implementation of the problem.

The solutions are all copied directly from the game, so should paste back into the game editor and run.
